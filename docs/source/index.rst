CyberGIS-HIV  
==================================================================

**CyberGIS-HIV is an application that utilizes CyberGISX to visualize spatiotemporal patterns of HIV rates and thirteen related variables**\ :sup:`1`  **such as the rates of Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**\ :sup:`2`  **use and HIV testing. This visualization spans from 2012 to 2018, also predicting HIV rates from 2019 to 2026 across U.S. counties. To compute these predictions, the model**\ :sup:`3`  **runs in the backend each time a user submits a job, dynamically presenting the results through a combination of maps and charts. These visualizations are interconnected, forming a coordinated and multiple views (CMV) interface. CMV is a dynamic visual interface where various data representations, such as maps and charts, are interactively linked. Changes in one representation immediately affect others through user operations like cross-filtering, brushing, highlighting, and selection.**

**One of the result visualizations from CyberGIS-HIV can be accessed at**: https://su-gis.org/HIV/MLC. **This visualization presents two maps, enabling users to compare the spatial distribution of variables such as 2012 HIV rates and 2022 HIV rates across U.S. counties. Additionally, the visualization incorporates a Multiple Linked Chart (MLC) allowing users to explore multiple time series charts simultaneously. For instance, when a user zooms in on a particular time frame in one of the time series charts, the rest of the charts are automatically zoomed in, representing the time series within the selected time frame. Additionally, clicking on a U.S. county in the map triggers the MLC to visualize spatiotemporal patterns of HIV rates and the thirteen related variables. Users can also opt to view the top 10 bar charts, illustrating the counties with the highest HIV rates within the current map extent.**

**The objective of CyberGIS-HIV is to empower researchers, healthcare experts, and policymakers in making well-informed decisions, efficiently allocating resources, and developing strategic approaches to combat the spread of HIV.**

**The video tutorials below provide step-by-step instructions for running the model to predict HIV and creating visualizations of the results. If you're interested in learning how to utilize the visual interface to explore spatio-temporal patterns of predicted HIV and related factors generated by the model, please jump to the third video clip.**

\ :sup:`1`  The thirteen HIV related variables are (1) the number of opioid prescriptions, (2) percentage of people participating in food stamp, (3) percentage of population in juvenile facilities, (4) the number of federally qualified health centers, (5), the number of NHSC primary care sites, (6) percentage of diagnosed infections among persons living with HIV infection, (7) HCV death, (8) the rate of HIV testing, (9) the number of community mental health centers (10) the rate of PrEP\ :sup:`2`  use, (11) percentage of households receiving social security income, (12) rate of illicit drug use, and (13) linkage to HIV care - i.e., percentage of diagnosed infections with at least one CD4 or viral load test performed less than month after diagnosis

\ :sup:`2`  PrEP is a preventive medication used to reduce the risk of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection in individuals who are at high risk of contracting the virus.

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------
If you do not have a CyerGISX account, create a CyberGISX account.
https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu

After you log in, go to the 'Discovery' tab and find the 'CyberGIS-HIV' project.

Click on the 'Open with CyberGISX' button. The CyberGIS-Jupyter page would automatically start running.
